## About this repo

This project is a code kata to optimize my use of my microwave.  

## Problem

Given a number of different ways to operate a microwave, which combination of buttons will result in the fewest button presses for a given duration?

## Variations

* Pressing the Add 30 Seconds button repeatedly.
* Using One Touch Start (pressing a button 1-9 and waiting 2 seconds for the microwave to start automatically).
* Typing in the desired duration in minutes and seconds followed by Start.
* Typing in the desired duration in seconds followed by Start.
* Choosing an initial duration and then removing 5 seconds at a time using the < or > key.
* From a database of special function buttons, choosing one of these with a compatible heating recipe for the desired time.

The microwave in my home is a Frigidaire Professional 1.8 Cu. Ft. 2-In-1 Over-The-Range Convection Microwave (FPBM3077RF).

## Why?

* Because I've thought about this problem since I moved in.
* Because I want to learn basic Python language and syntax.

## Out of Scope

Convection Cooking -- I don't even know how to cook with this feature, so I'm not going to pretend to program it either!
